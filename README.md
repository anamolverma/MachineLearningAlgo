# MachineLearningAlgo
Basic machine learning algorithms to make predictions based on given dataset
Here, we have a dataset "details.csv", where the first column is the number of hours of study and second column is the marks obtained by studing the corresponding number of hours.
Student Percentage.ipynb is a python file where simple machine learning model is made using simple regression technique to predict outcomes.
